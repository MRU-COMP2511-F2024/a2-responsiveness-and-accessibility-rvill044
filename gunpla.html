            Another one of my hobbies is Gunpla, which stands for Gundam plastic model. I recently picked up this hobby
            last year and it turned into one of my favourite passtimes. Its insanely therapeutic building a model and
            the satisfaction of the completed build is just priceless. The image on the right is one of my completed
            kits, it is Eric Manthfield's Master Grade, 1/100 scale High Mobility Zaku II.

            <figcaption>This is a Premium Bandai exclusive, Bandai being the company that creates Gunpla. Premium Bandai, or P-Bandai takes an existing kit and modifies the kit. Is a different
                IP from Gundam in which its called 30 Minute Missions, where the kits are suppose to take 30 minutes to
                complete. This kit took me around 5-6 hours to complete, the kit is called the bEXM-28 Revernova.</figcaption>
