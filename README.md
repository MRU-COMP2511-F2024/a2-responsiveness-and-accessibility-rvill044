# Web Accessibility

## https://chimerical-piroshki-5069dd.netlify.app/

## document the category of issues that you identified through the manual and automated analysis above
Honesty, it seems that I didn't have that much of issues regarding webstie accessibility other than the contact me not working. However, I decided to ignore this warning because recalling from one of the labs doing forms, it required Javascript to work. Therefore I decided that its worth ignoring for now, however, if the JS was supplied or required in this assignment, I would've went back and fixed it.

## What kinds of changes did you have to make (I do not want a list here). Generalize the types of issues that you created when building your website, and then the general type of changes that you made to resolve those issues.
Honesty, the biggest issue for me was formating the website in the first place, then making it responsive. Getting the elements on the page to line up on the specific parts of the grid to lineup was extra tricky for me. Furthermore depending on the size of the text, caused the contact form element to stretch out of bounds. Therefore, I used the max-height method to directly assign the max height of the element in order to match the contact form elements to the size of the page.

## How do these accessibility changes connect with the Gestalt principles we discussed earlier this semester?
The accessibility changes connect to the gestalt principles dicussed earlier in the semester in a way that accessibility and the gestalt principles go hand in hand. For example, the imagine being the prominent thing you see when you first open the webpage. Furthermore, using a colour palette that blend together for a seemless finish can signifcantly boosts the readers interest as well as attention to the webpage.

ps. i should've worked on my commit messages but got lazy oops
