        <p>I started going to the gym back in Janurary of 2023, so I've been lifting for just over one and a half years.
            I'm also blessed with friends who were already going to the gym that had no problem with taking me under
            their wing, to which I'm forever grateful.

            Lifting weights has become something I'm very passionate in, which, although I'm taking a haitus, I do want
            to compete in powerlifting someday.
